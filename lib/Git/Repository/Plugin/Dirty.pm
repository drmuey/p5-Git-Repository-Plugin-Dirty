    my $git = Git::Repository->new( { fatal => ["!0"], quiet => ( $verbose ? 0 : 1 ), } );

    if ($git->is_dirty) {
        if ($force) {

    Use subsections (=head2, =head3) as appropriate.


=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 $git->is_dirty()

Returns true if there are staged or unstaged changes.

=head2 $git->is_dirty(untracked => 1)

Also return true if there are untracked files.

=head2 $git->has_unstaged_changes()

Returns true if there are unstaged changes.

=head2 $git->has_staged_changes()

Returns true if there are staged changes.

=head2 $git->has_untracked()

Returns a list of untracked files.

=head2 $git->diff_unstaged()

Returns an array of lines making up the diff of unstaged changes.

=head2 $git->diff_unstaged(\&output_handler)

For each line of the unstaged changes diff this handler is called.

It is passed the git object and the line.

Returning true will continue to the next line.

Returning false will stop the command.


    $git->diff_staged(sub {
        my ($git,$line) = @_;

        if ($line =~ m/API_KEY:(.*)/) {
            my $api_key = $1;
            update_api_key_on_ci_boxes($api_key);
            return; # since we found what we where looking for we can stop
        }

        return 1; # keep going
    });

=head2 $git->diff_staged()

Returns an array of lines making up the diff of unstaged changes.

=head2 $git->diff_staged(\&output_handler)

Same as C<diff_staged()> but for staged changes.

=head2 $git->current_branch()

Returns the current branch. Useful for determining why a repo is dirty and what to do about it.
